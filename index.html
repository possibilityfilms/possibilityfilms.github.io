          An aging, troubled man sneaks away from his caregiver and wanders the streets of Barcelona driven to solve a
          mystery he can only describe with the words, “No more time.” (7 minutes)

          Shot over two days while on family vacation in southern Spain, I hired a local Barcelona co-producer and crew
          and a cast of international actors, each speaking in their native language.

          Leroy Silk is a middle-aged, singer-songwriter whose popularity and songwriting suddenly crashed 9 years ago.
          He passively recycles his old, folk-rock songs for online subscribers until one enthusiastic fan opens old
          creative wounds by requesting a song that Leroy claims doesn't exist. The film immerses viewers in a
          simulated, online environment in which the cracked heart of a fading singer-songwriter is healed through his
          fan community. (20 minutes)
        </p>

          ​This film was produced entirely online during the 2021 pandemic with a cast and crew of 4 and features
          original music written for the film.

          On April 30, 2023, cast and crew appeared in an online event for a live-streamed premiere of the film after
          which they answered questions about the process of making the film and the music.
